# StoneyQuizBot
Small language quiz program for my Stoney Nakoda Language course

For fellow students not familiar with running python scripts all you need to do is:
  -Download python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  -Download StoneyQuiz.py (click the green "code" drop down button to download a zip file (can also use the git command in the terminal to do this)
  -open up a terminal emulator (terminal, console, powershell, st...)
  -move into the folder that the python script is saved in (this can be done using the change directory command (cd) ie. cd downloads)
  -then type python StoneyQuiz.py and it should start running directly in the terminal
  (I am not very familiar with programming stuff in windows/mac so it might be as easy as right clicking the script and opening with the terminal itself)
  
 The intention for this script was to make it, in its current form anyways, very extendable so that adding sentences was easy (for example in the code you will find a question template). 
 
 Things to incorportate:
 I couldn't figure out how to include complex symbols like the nasality feature so including those is another direction I would like to take. 
 Building a .txt file that has the questions in them of which the quiz script would grab a set number of at random.
